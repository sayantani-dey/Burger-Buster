# Burger Buster 
For those trying to eat less unhealthy food
### Description:
This project tackles the challenge of food image classification for promoting healthy eating habits. It implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy food images.

### Key components:
- Dataset:
  - A curated dataset of food images categorized as healthy and unhealthy.
  - Training and validation folders further divided into healthy and unhealthy subfolders.
  - A separate test folder containing images for model evaluation (mention the number of images).
- Model:
  - A CNN architecture is implemented for image classification.
  - Achieved an accuracy of 75% on the validation set (mention validation approach if possible, e.g., split, k-fold).
  - Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of CNNs in classifying food images for dietary awareness. The provided code and dataset can serve as a foundation for further exploration and improvement.
